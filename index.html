        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman undergraduate student at Bob Jones University studying Christian Ministries with a minor in Counseling.
			I am from Plymouth, Massachusetts. I also work two jobs during the summer when I am home from college.
			One of my jobs is a cashier at Walmart in the morning and my other job is a food server at a restaurant during the night.
			During my spare time, I hang out with friends or relax and read my Bible at the beach in the afternoons. 
			
				
         </p>
         <p>
            When I am on campus, I am involved on the weekends in ministry outreachs promoted by my society and 
            my church, Palmetto Baptist Church, which is in Powdersville, SC.
			The Lord has called me to the ministry to begin church-planting or start a camp ministry 
			in the New England area where I currently live off-campus in Massachusetts. 
			
         </p> 
         <p>
             I enjoy running, and working out on campus after classes end. I serve in my local church at home 
			 as a Vacation Bible School teacher and occassionally encourage teens in my youth group with a short devotional.
